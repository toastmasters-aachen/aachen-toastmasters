# Du bist bereits Mitglied? Prima! 

Every new member should get a proper introduction to the club when they join but there is not always time to do an official intro meeting.

✨ Proposed solution: Every member gets an onboarding mentor.

📑 How it works:

    mentor can be anyone who has done their ice breaker, (ideally someone who finished level 1 or is part of TM for a bit of time)

    limited time-frame: until the ice breaker speech is done

    fixed objectives: see checklist below
