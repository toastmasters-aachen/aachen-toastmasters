Contests are an opportunity to coordinate and manage a relatively larger event, manage new tasks, and of course stress-test the public speaking skills we develop throughout the rest of the year! How far can we go?  If we don't register, we shall never know!

Please contact our VP of Education to see if you qualify to compete.  Moderators, Judges, Timers and other support members are also needed.  Dates and venues to be announced soon!
