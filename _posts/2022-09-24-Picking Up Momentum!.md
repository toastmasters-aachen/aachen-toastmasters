# Thanks to all the new faces that have dropped in to visit!

And all Veterans who have come back to hang out!  Our club is intensively executing towards its goals, and having a lot of fun in the process.  Big thanks to Lucy D for the refresher seminar on the Pathways program, a virtual system of support material intended to give each member tools and guidelines to improve in their selected areas of communicatons and leadership.
