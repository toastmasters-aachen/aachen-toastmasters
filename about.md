# Mentoring Makes and Keeps us Strong!

Mentoring is a resource and skill set that is integrated in our Pathways Program, and is vital to our club's thriving culture!  
Tips:  
If there is someone with whom you would like to work, simply ask them if they are available.
If yes, discuss logistics including availability, goals, expectations and which communication tools will be used.
If that works, do a test run for a month!
If that works, continue for 5 more months and don't forget to celebrate your achievement at the end!
Our Board is always there to support if needed!

# Testmonials

I used to work in the area of software development and in a modern company even a single developer is a leader. Why? Because a team should take decisions about itself.  Very often I had to explain my position and convince the colleagues about my ideas. What could help me here better than the TM prepared speeches?
However, this is the obvious part. It took me a while to discover the hidden power of Toastmasters, and this was the evaluations. At work, we had every month the so called, 'retrospective', where we look back and try to improve our processes. Through the evaluations I've developed a critical eye not only for the achievements but also for the potential improvements and I applied this method also to the communication with my colleagues.

As I moved on to new areas, team coaching, I could try things out as mini projects in the Toastmasters evenings, and as fun as it is, I thought of the table topic questions when I was giving an interview for a new position.
Toastmasters has helped me gain more confidence about what I say and this is reflected automatically in my everyday life. The group has been a safety net to develop myself.
